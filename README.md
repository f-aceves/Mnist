Logistic Regression Model that correctly identifies handwritten images of numbers 0 through 9

Along with making a model, I added a dataframe with various hyperparameters to optimize the validation accuracy.
I manually created this Grid search of 15 different combinations.


The result was a test accuracy of 97%
